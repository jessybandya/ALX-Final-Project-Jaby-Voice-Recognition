This repository hosts an e-commerce website built using Next.js, React.js, and various technologies. It offers a wide range of features, including user registration and login, shopping, cart management, checkout with M-Pesa integration, and voice recognition (although not supported by all browsers). The project also utilizes Firebase for data storage, Redux for state management, and offers a seamless user experience with Material UI and Tailwind CSS styling.

### Importance of Voice Recognition Apps

2. **Convenience**: These apps provide a hands-free and eyes-free way to control devices, enhancing convenience in tasks like sending messages, setting reminders, and web searches.
